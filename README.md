# corona-tracker

The core idea is a simple, viral, way to track contacts. 

This idea isn't even half-baked yet, it may be a terrible idea, 
or someone else might be doing it, or there may be a gotcha I've missed. 

Critique is very welcome - mitra@mitra.biz or post to an issue in Git.

NOTE - THIS IS GOING TO GET AN UPDATE AFTER THE MEETING WITH Ric ESP RELATING TO LOCATION DAA

### How it works 
#### "check-in"

Once its up and running, a participant might: 
* enter an event, a store or a train carriage.
* see a visibly posted sign with a QR code
* scan that code into their browser
 
No further action is required, but the page offers options to:
* Download a QR code to post somewhere else
* Register - if a first time user - can enter email (or SMS) for notifications.
* Check for anywhere else you've been in case of reports

If there is no QR code, we'll suggest nearby ones (maybe in same business);
and if there are node we'll just use location, 
and suggest they printout a QR code, or suggest it to the business/venue.

#### When someone is positive

Another link should be used if you test positive.

At this point the system figures out:
* where you've been
* who else was there (after you) 
* it sends them notifications. 

### Getting it out there.

The design is intended to be viral - i.e.
* as a business owner, transit driver, meeting organizer, 
  you can print out the QR code - which attracts attention of users
* as a user, you can click even if the business has no visible QR code
* Its useful even if its only one event with 50 people. 

### Technology

QR code gets a URL - URL contains a random number for the code. 
Location is tracked at same time, giving us two ways to get a place.

We can use registration, cookies, 
or browser fingerprinting to identify a person. 
We encourage registration to allow for notifications, but don't require it
in order to reduce privacy concerns (especially in oppressive regimes)

Matching contacts is a bit harder, can start naive 
and add some AI once we find someone once we find people who know what they are 
doing. 

#### Challenges

I think the core tech is relatively easy, 
but I see (at least) the following challenges, 
and at this point I'm certain I've missed some.

* What the algorithm is for an "overlap" i.e. person A was in this location, 
  person B came later.
* Handling unregistered users (cookie &/or browser fingerprinting)
* Human factors - like how to word notifications
* I'm Not sure how well QR scanning works on iPhones,
  may need to go to a bookmark then scan
* If it scales enough to be useful, the server side process has to be cheap,
  and scalable. 
* Should be internationalized - would probably get help with this. 
* Legal and privacy disclaimers. 

#### Technology choices

I think this starts off as a simple React website, 
(I chose React simply because I know it, and we don't have time to go through 
a learning cycle). 
Web components would be possible if someone has the skills.

Because of potential issues getting it to scan QR codes on iPhone it could
possibly go to a React-Native app, but I've never used that and I'm not sure
how slow the approval process is to get it up and running. 
I also don't know if you can put a download on the site to do this. 

Back end could either be
* sqlite, then scaling to another SQL DB.
* simple text file since 90% is adding something to a list - 
  but as it scales searching this could bring scaling issues.

#### Money

In terms of cost, I think we can cover any initial costs by volunteers
and use of servers etc we already have access to.  
If it scales that could be an issue.

Zero cost to users, it needs volume.

I'd like to keep this clean - no selling of data to anyone, 
and ideally no ads etc (display public health info and links instead of ads)

### Skills and Resources needed

* UI Design - who ?
* UI coding - React - I could do initial part if dont have anyone
* App coding - React-native ? - need a volunteer.
* Server coding - Node - I could do.
* Server algorithms - Trivial to start, then AI (approach Alan)
* Server hosting - will ask IA to start, then possibly scale to AWS (approach Dan A)
* Getting the word out - who ?
